# What is TantaresCFG?
TantaresCFG or Tantares Configs is a VERY UNOFFICIAL set of collated and new configs for the Tantares mods. Currenly the mod provides updated EngineIgnitor and Waterfall support and some additional B9 switches for parts, as well as a handful of balancing tweaks and a couple new features. The goal of this mod is to try and bring Tantares closer in line with the fidelity and mod support of BDB, while also being modular enough that parts you don't want to use can be deleted without fear of breaking anything else.

Please note that these configs have not been tested with or made with standard gameplay progression in mind, although tech tree progression and actual cost balancing is planned in future.
