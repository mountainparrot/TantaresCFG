# What is TantaresCFG?
TantaresCFG or Tantares Configs is a pet project by me(! @mountainparrot aka @Kea_172) with updated EngineIgnitor and Waterfall configs for the Tantares mods as well as adding more subtypes for some engines to try and bring Tantares closer in line with the fidelity and mod support of Bluedog Design Bureau.

## Dependencies
 - B9PartSwitch
 - EngineIgnitor
 - Waterfall
 - CryoTanks
