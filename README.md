# What is this?
A set of collated and new configs for various mods, mainly Tantares (+LV, SP and SAF). Some configs will break things.
Pretty much all of these haven't been tested with or made with standard gameplay progression in mind, maybe in future. Be mindful for now.

Currently incompatible with Chemical Technologies, although hopefully this can be fixed in future.
