# What is TantaresCFG?
TantaresCFG or Tantares Configs is an unofficial set of collated and new configs providing updated EngineIgnitor and Waterfall support for the Tantares mods, as well as some additional B9 switches for parts to try and bring Tantares closer in line with the fidelity and mod support of BDB.

Please note that these configs have not been tested with or made with standard gameplay progression in mind, although tech tree progression and actual cost balancing is planned in future.
